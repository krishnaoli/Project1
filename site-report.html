          <h1>Summary</h1>
          <p> In this report, I will be discussing about my website. I have learnt  
              many new things during doing this assignment.This assignment has looked at several aspects of web development like designing, font and text, background-color,images, different tags and references. I will explain briefly the every aspects of this website.</p>

          <h2>Aspects</h2>
          <p> As you can see form my website, mostly I used two font-family(sans-serif and serif).<br>Font-size of maximum 45px and minimun 12px.<br>
          And about background color, I choose all the color form W3Schools(HTML Color Picker).<br>
          The images I used was all from internet for which I will be refrencing it. <br>
          All the different tags are used correctly in right places.</p>

          <h3> Experience</h3>
           <p>  My experience was fantastic. It's true that I have to face lots of ups and downs. Like, how a single missing semi colon can waste a lot of time and a single wrong tag can ruin our page. I also faced a little isssue at checking validation.Some of my code did not pass the validation check. It was because I was not aware of HTML lang attribute.
           To be honest I did not know about HTML lang attribute and when I checked it in browser, It was just for which language are we writing our code but it was necessary to write down.<br><br> At first, doing this assignment it was little frustrating, but later it was fun. The plus point was that I got help from my friends. Using all those transition and  animation was fun. It was my very first time doing such project. The experience that I got from this project was brand new.</p>
